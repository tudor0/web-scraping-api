Running the project:
`yarn || npm install`
`yarn dev || npm run dev`

Explanation:
This is a simple webscraping site, built with React, Typescript, NextJS, Pupeeteer and TailwindCSS.

The frontend code is located at src/pages/index.tsx
The backend code is located at src/pages/api/hello.ts

While I had no prior experience with web scraping, this was a really interesing project to make, but due to time limitations, I have only completed the required tasks, but I am happy to discuss some of the ideas I had for the project.

Some of the ideas I had for the project:
- Take into account the device type, some websites have different layouts for mobile and desktop, so it would be interesting to have a way to select the device type.
- Block ads and trackers, this would be a nice feature to have.
- Full JSON DOM response
- JS Instructions, this would allow for the user to interact with elements on the page.

All in all, this was an extremely fun project to make, it was done in a couple of hours, so I hope you enjoy it!
